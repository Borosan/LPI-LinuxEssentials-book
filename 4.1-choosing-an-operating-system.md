MacOS:

* MacOS is generally considered more secure compared to Windows. While vulnerabilities can occur, the system’s architecture and lower popularity make it less attractive to attackers.
* Apple actively employs threat prevention methods such as [Gatekeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeper_\(macOS\)) and XProtect, which help protect users from downloading malware. Nevertheless, Mac users should also take precautions and install security updates.

Linux:

* Linux is known for its security and reliability. Its open structure and active developer community help quickly identify and fix vulnerabilities. Most Linux distributions feature a permission system that minimizes the chance of system damage.
* However, Linux users should also consider risks related to improper system configuration. For example, **installing software** from untrusted sources can lead to vulnerabilities.

#### Performance and Stability

Windows:

* The performance of Windows can vary depending on the computer’s configuration. Despite improvements in the latest versions, users sometimes experience issues such like freezes or slowdowns following updates.
* On older systems, Windows might run slowly if proper attention isn’t given to settings and the amount of free disk space.

MacOS:

* MacOS provides high stability and excellent performance on Apple devices optimized for this OS. Users report that the system runs smoothly and without crashes, even when performing resource-intensive tasks like video editing or graphic work.
* Thanks to Apple’s strict quality control over both applications and hardware, compatibility and performance of MacOS are often top-notch.

Linux:

* Linux is often regarded as the most stable operating system. Many servers worldwide use Linux because it can operate for extended periods without needing to reboot. Various Linux distributions are optimized for operation on different platforms, allowing for high performance even on older hardware.

### Software Release Life Cycle (SRLC)

The SRLC describes the sequential stages of development and maturity for a _single version_ or _release_ of the software, from pre-testing to final production availability. It focuses on the specific progression leading up to a product launch.

* Goal: To manage and communicate the maturity level of a specific software version before it reaches the end-user.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (104).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Key Stages:
  * Pre-Alpha: Early development; internal testing.
  * Alpha: First phase of testing, usually internal, unstable, and incomplete features.
  * Beta: Wider testing with a select or open group of external users; generally feature-complete but potentially buggy.
  * Release Candidate (RC): A version stable enough for final testing; potentially the final product unless critical bugs are found.
  * General Availability (GA) / Production Release: The final, stable version available to the public.

### **Linux Maintenance Cycles**&#x20;

A **Linux maintenance cycle** refers to the predictable schedule of:

* **Security patches**
* **Bug fixes**
* **Feature updates**
* **Support lifetime**\
  provided by a Linux distribution.

Different distros follow different lifecycle models.
