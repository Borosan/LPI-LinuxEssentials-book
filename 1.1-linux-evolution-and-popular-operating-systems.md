### What is Linux?

Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn’t function.<br>

### Why use Linux?

This is the one question that most people ask. Why bother learning a completely different computing environment, when the operating system that ships with most desktops, laptops, and servers works just fine?

To answer that question, I would pose another question. Does that operating system you’re currently using really work “just fine”? Or, do you find yourself battling obstacles like viruses, malware, slow downs, crashes, costly repairs, and licensing fees?\
If you struggle with the above, Linux might be the perfect platform for you. Linux has evolved into one of the most reliable computer ecosystems on the planet. Combine that reliability with zero cost of entry and you have the perfect solution for a desktop platform.

That’s right, zero cost of entry… as in free. You can install Linux on as many computers as you like without paying a cent for software or server licensing.\

### Open source

Linux is also distributed under an open source license. Open source follows these key tenets:

* The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.

These points are crucial to understanding the community that works together to create the Linux platform. Without a doubt, Linux is an operating system that is “by the people, for the people”. These tenets are also a main factor in why many people choose Linux. It’s about freedom and freedom of use and freedom of choice.

### The Birth of Linux <a href="#item-1" id="item-1"></a>

The story of Linux began with the concept of Unix, a powerful and versatile operating system. However, Unix was expensive and proprietary, limiting its accessibility. In 1984, a simpler Unix-like system called Minix emerged, sparking the interest of a young Finnish student named Linus Torvalds.<br>

<div align="center"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (124).png" alt="Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, started Linux as a hobby project in 1991." width="125"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, started Linux as a hobby project in 1991.

\
**August 25th 1991:** Linus Torvalds made a [now-famous post](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html) to the MINIX newsgroup announcing his work on a free operating system for 386(486) AT clones. He stated it was “just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like gnu.” Little did he know, this “hobby” would revolutionize the tech world.

> Hello everybody out there using minix -
>
> I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).
>
> I've currently ported [bash(1.08)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_\(Unix_shell\)) and [gcc(1.40)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)
>
> Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)
>
> PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.

> — Linus Torvalds

{% hint style="info" %}
**GNU Project:**

The GNU Project is a long-running effort started in 1983 by Richard Stallman to create a completely free and open operating system that anyone can use, study, change, and share. GNU provides many of the core tools used on Linux systems today, such as compilers, libraries, and command-line utilities. The idea was to build a system similar to Unix but without any restrictions or proprietary code. Although the GNU Project created most of the operating system components, its own kernel (called Hurd) was never fully finished, so many systems use the GNU tools together with the Linux kernel — which is why the whole system is sometimes called “GNU/Linux.”
{% endhint %}



#### **September 17th 1991**&#x20;

&#x20;Linux version 0.01 was released, containing the initial code and basic functionality. The first usable version of Linux, version 0.02, came out in October 1991, consisting of approximately 10,239 lines of code.<br>

#### **1992: The Year Linux Became Open Source**

The early development of the Linux kernel saw its distribution restricted by non-commercial licenses. However, a crucial decision was made to the Linux kernel in 1992 with the release of version 0.12. It was relicensed under the [GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html), marking a significant shift in Linux evolution.

This switch from a non-commercial license to the GPL made Linux open source, allowing anyone to freely use, modify, and distribute the kernel. Linus Torvalds himself considers this decision to be the best he ever made.<br>

#### The Rise of Linux

The fledgling Linux kernel found a perfect partner in the GNU Project: a group developing a free and open-source operating system. The GNU Project provided essential components like utilities and [Linux tools](https://tuxcare.com/blog/essential-linux-security-tools-a-comprehensive-overview-for-security-professionals/) that, when combined with the Linux kernel, formed the foundation for a complete GNU/Linux operating system.

As Linux grew, the need for complete operating systems built around it also grew. This critical need led to the creation of Linux distributions, or “distros.”

These distributions packaged the Linux kernel with other free and open-source software, creating complete operating systems and propelling the Linux evolution forward.

### What is a “distribution?”

Linux has a number of different versions to suit any type of user. From new users to hard-core users, you’ll find a “flavor” of Linux to match your needs. These versions are called distributions (or, in the short form, “distros”). Nearly every distribution of Linux can be downloaded for free, burned onto disk (or USB thumb drive), and installed (on as many machines as you like).

Popular Linux distributions include:

* LINUX MINT
* MANJARO
* DEBIAN
* UBUNTU
* ANTERGOS
* SOLUS
* FEDORA
* ELEMENTARY OS
* OPENSUSE

Each distribution has a different take on the desktop. Some opt for very modern user interfaces (such as GNOME and Elementary OS’s Pantheon), whereas others stick with a more traditional desktop environment (openSUSE uses KDE).

{% hint style="info" %}
You can check out the top 100 distributions on the [Distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/).
{% endhint %}

And don’t think the server has been left behind. For this arena, you can turn to:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux
* Ubuntu Server
* Centos
* SUSE Enterprise Linux

Some of the above server distributions are free (such as Ubuntu Server and CentOS) and some have an associated price (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Enterprise Linux). Those with an associated price also include support. in summary:

| Debian Based           | Redhat Based      | Other          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Debian                 | RHEL              | Arch           |
| Ubuntu                 | Fedora            | Slackware      |
| Ubuntu Variants        | CentsOS           | Suse           |
| Linux Mint             | Rocky             | Android        |
| Any .deb based systems | RPM based systems | Embede Systems |

{% hint style="info" %}
### Which distribution is right for you?

Which distribution you use will depend on the answer to three simple questions:

* How skilled of a computer user are you?
* Do you prefer a modern or a standard desktop interface?
* Server or desktop?

If your computer skills are fairly basic, you’ll want to stick with a newbie-friendly distribution such as Linux Mint, Ubuntu , Elementary OS or Deepin. If your skill set extends into the above-average range, you could go with a distribution like Debian or Fedora. If, however, you’ve pretty much mastered the craft of computer and system administration, use a distribution like Gentoo. If you really want a challenge, you can build your very own Linux distribution, with the help of Linux From Scratch.

If you’re looking for a server-only distribution, you will also want to decide if you need a desktop interface, or if you want to do this via command-line only. The Ubuntu Server does not install a GUI interface. This means two things your server won’t be bogged down loading graphics and you’ll need to have a solid understanding of the Linux command line. However, you can install a GUI package on top of the Ubuntu Server with a single command like `sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop`. System administrators will also want to view a distribution with regards to features. Do you want a server-specific distribution that will offer you, out of the box, everything you need for your server? If so, CentOS might be the best choice. Or, do you want to take a desktop distribution and add the pieces as you need them? If so, Debian or Ubuntu Linux might serve you well.<br>
{% endhint %}

#### 1994: Linux 1.0.0 Arrived

On March 14th, Linux 1.0.0 was released, consisting of 176,250 lines of code and providing support for single-processor Intel 80386 (i386) systems.

#### 1996:Tux: Symbol of Linux

<h4 align="center"> <img src=".gitbook/assets/image (96).png" alt=""></h4>

&#x20;

In 1996, Linus Torvalds announced that Linux would have a penguin mascot, inspired by an incident where he was bitten by a little penguin during a visit to the National Zoo & Aquarium in Canberra, Australia. Larry Ewing created the original draft based on this idea. The name Tux, suggested by James Hughes, is a play on “Torvalds’ UniX” and “tuxedo,” reflecting the penguin’s appearance. Since its creation, Tux has remained the symbol of Linux for over two decades.<br>

#### 1996: Linux Kernel 2.0

The Linux kernel 2.0 was released, introducing support for multiple processors in a single system (SMP) and more extensive hardware compatibility.

#### 1999: Windows Refund Day

On February 15, 1999, in a playful protest known as “[Windows Refund Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Refund_Day),” Linux users around the world visited Microsoft offices, attempting to return the unused Windows licenses that came bundled with their computers.

#### 1998-2000: Entering Enterprise

The late 1990s and early 2000s witnessed a paradigm shift in the Linux evolution: a surge of interest from the business world. Major tech companies began to recognize the potential of Linux, leading to several key developments:

&#x20;

* 1999: IBM joined forces with Red Hat, [announcing](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/press-ibmalliance) support for Linux
* 1999: Dell began pre-installing Linux on select servers
* 2000: The GNOME and KDE desktop environments evolved, making Linux more user friendly for desktop users.
* 2000: IBM [invested $1 billion](https://www.ibm.com/opensource/story/) in Linux development.

&#x20;

#### 2003: The SCO Group Lawsuit <a href="#item-4" id="item-4"></a>

The SCO Group (SCO) launched a [legal assault](https://www.zdnet.com/article/after-almost-20-years-the-sco-vs-ibm-lawsuit-may-finally-be-ending/) in 2003, suing IBM for $1 billion. They claimed that Linux contained copyrighted Unix code. This battle, which ultimately failed, underscored the importance of understanding the legal and historical context of Linux’s intellectual property.

### 2004: Ubuntu 4.10 Released <a href="#item-5" id="item-5"></a>

On October 20, 2004, Canonical Ltd. released Ubuntu 4.10, codenamed “Warty Warthog,” a distribution that made Linux more accessible to non-geek users and significantly boosted its adoption on desktops and laptops.<br>

{% hint style="info" %}
### &#x20;Linus Torvalds’ Git <a href="#item-7" id="item-7"></a>

2005: The creation of Git by Linus Torvalds revolutionized version control, becoming an essential tool for software development and marking a significant milestone in the Linux evolution.
{% endhint %}

&#x20;

### Modern Era and the Future (2011-Present) <a href="#item-8" id="item-8"></a>

&#x20;

Linux has expanded its reach beyond traditional computers, powering mobile devices like smartphones through Android (a mobile OS based on the Linux kernel) and [embedded systems](https://tuxcare.com/blog/understanding-linux-kernel-security-for-embedded-systems/) that control everything from smart TVs to industrial robots. In the realm of supercomputing, Linux’s efficiency and scalability have made it the dominant force. It powers all of the [top 500 supercomputers](https://itsfoss.com/linux-runs-top-supercomputers/) in the world, facilitating groundbreaking research and simulations in various fields.

The rise of cloud computing has further solidified Linux’s position. Cloud platforms like Amazon Web Service (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) run primarily on Linux for their infrastructure. Additionally, containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, which enable efficient application deployment, are built upon the foundation of Linux.

In April 2015, version 4.0 of the Linux kernel was [released](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2015/04/linux-kernel-4-0-new-features), which included significant improvements to live kernel patching capabilities and also sparked discussions about Linux’s C library choices, such as [musl vs glibc](https://tuxcare.com/blog/musl-vs-glibc/). [Live patching](https://tuxcare.com/resources/learning/live-patching/) allows applying kernel updates without requiring a system reboot. However, it is not an entirely new concept to the Linux ecosystem.&#x20;

As we look to the future, the Linux evolution continues to thrive, driven by several key trends:

&#x20;

* Increased focus on security and containerization
* Advancements in real-time computing for critical systems
* Continued expansion in emerging fields like AI and machine learning
* Growing adoption in desktop environments

&#x20;

### Embedded System

#### What are embedded systems?

Embedded systems are microprocessors that are used in devices other than standard desktop, workstation, and laptop computers used in homes and offices. The term refers to microprocessors intended to perform a specific, limited function in a device with a primary function other than those done by traditional computers. They are commonly found in small computer-like devices such as tablets and portable games; communications devices such as cell phones; equipment that processes audio and video data such as cameras, toys, and video recording devices; and components that control other devices such as appliances, vehicles, and military applications.

#### What is Embedded Linux?

Embedded Linux refers to the use of the Linux kernel, along with a comprehensive set of libraries and utilities, within embedded systems or devices. These systems, which are designed for specific functions, often feature constraints on resources like processing power, memory, and energy consumption. Linux, due to its open-source nature, flexibility, and robustness, has become a popular choice for these systems.

From our smartphones and smart TVs to routers, cars, and even spacecraft, embedded Linux powers a wide range of devices. Its usage spans across various sectors, including telecommunications, automotive, aerospace, home appliances, and more. The widespread adoption of Linux in embedded systems is mainly due to its ability to be customized for a particular application, its robust community support, and its cost-effectiveness.

The importance of embedded Linux in the technology industry is vast. As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow, the role of embedded Linux becomes even more significant. It’s not just about providing a platform for these devices to operate, but also about ensuring interoperability, security, and efficient use of resources.<br>

### Rasspery Pi

Raspberry Pi is a low cost, **credit-card sized computer** that plugs into a computer monitor or TV and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.<br>

### What is Raspbian? <img src=".gitbook/assets/image (100).png" alt="" data-size="line">

Raspbian is a free operating system based on Debian, optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware. It comes with over 35,000 packages, pre-compiled software bundled in a nice format for easy installation on your Raspberry Pi. The main goal of Raspbian is to provide an easy-to-use OS for Raspberry Pi users, with a focus on programming, computing, and educational projects.

### Android

#### what is Android?

Android is an operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software, designed primarily for touchscreen-based mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.

<p align="center"><br><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (74).png" alt=""></p>

#### Android History

Android began in 2003 as a project of the American [technology](https://www.britannica.com/technology/technology) company Android Inc., to develop an operating system for digital cameras. In 2004 the project changed to become an operating system for smartphones. Android Inc., was bought by the American [search engine](https://www.britannica.com/technology/search-engine) company [Google Inc.](https://www.britannica.com/money/Google-Inc), in 2005. At Google, the Android team decided to base their project on [Linux](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Linux), an [open source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/open-source) operating system for [personal computers](https://www.britannica.com/technology/personal-computer).

\
On November 5, 2007, Google announced the founding of the Open Handset Alliance, a [consortium](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consortium) of dozens of technology and [mobile telephone](https://www.britannica.com/technology/mobile-telephone) companies, including [Intel Corporation](https://www.britannica.com/money/Intel), [Motorola, Inc.](https://www.britannica.com/money/Motorola-Inc), [NVIDIA Corporation](https://www.britannica.com/money/NVIDIA-Corporation), [Texas Instruments Incorporated](https://www.britannica.com/money/Texas-Instruments-Incorporated), LG Electronics, Inc., Samsung Electronics, Sprint Nextel Corporation, and T-Mobile (Deutsche Telekom). The consortium was created in order to develop and promote Android as a free open source operating system with support for third-party applications. Android-based devices use wireless networks in order to take full advantage of features such as one-touch Google searches, [Google Docs](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Google-Docs) (e.g., word editors, spreadsheets), and [Google Earth](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Google-Earth) (satellite mapping software).

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (76).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The first [cellular telephone](https://www.britannica.com/technology/cell-phone) to feature the new operating system was the T-Mobile G1, released on October 22, 2008. In 2012 Android became the most popular operating system for mobile devices, [surpassing](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/surpassing) Apple’s [iOS](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iOS), and, as of 2020, about 75 percent of mobile devices run Android.<br>

#### Chrome OS

ChromeOS is an operating system designed and developed by Google.It is derived from the open-source [ChromiumOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChromiumOS) operating system (which itself is derived from [Gentoo Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_Linux)), and uses the Google Chrome web browser as its principal user interface.

Google announced the project in July 2009, initially describing it as an operating system where applications and user data would reside in the cloud. ChromeOS was used primarily to run web applications.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (91).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

ChromeOS supports progressive web applications, Android apps from Google Play and Linux applications.[<sup>\[</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChromeOS#cite_note-11)<br>

### Linux in the Cloud

#### What Is Cloud Computing? <a href="#item-1" id="item-1"></a>

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, allowing you to access servers, databases, networking, software, artificial intelligence, and more, on a pay-as-you-go basis. This allows for flexible resources, faster innovation, and economies of scale, as companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud services provider, instead of owning and maintaining their own computing infrastructure or data centers. You only pay for what you use, avoiding upfront costs and reducing ongoing maintenance expenses. &#x20;

#### Why Linux for Cloud Computing?

Linux is a popular operating system for cloud computing due to its robustness, flexibility, and cost effectiveness. Here are some reasons why it’s the preferred choice for many users:

Open Source: Linux is open source, meaning it’s free to use and modify. This translates to significant cost savings compared to proprietary systems.

Security: Linux is known for its [security features](https://tuxcare.com/blog/demystifying-linux-kernel-security-the-need-for-linux-kernel-patching/), which are crucial for managing cloud environments where data security is paramount. However, proper configuration and security practices are essential for optimal [cloud security](https://tuxcare.com/blog/cloud-security/).

Compatibility: Most cloud platforms, including [AWS](https://tuxcare.com/blog/addressing-linux-kernel-aws-vulnerabilities/), [Google Cloud](https://tuxcare.com/blog/google-cloud-patched-privilege-escalation-vulnerability/), and Microsoft Azure, are built on or offer strong support for Linux. Many cloud-native tools and services are also designed to run seamlessly on Linux.

Community Support: The vast Linux community serves as a valuable resource for cloud users. You’ll have access to troubleshooting assistance, knowledge sharing, and collaboration opportunities, ensuring you’re never alone on your cloud journey.
