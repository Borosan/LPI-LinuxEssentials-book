### What is Desktop Environment in Linux? <a href="#what-is-desktop-environment-in-linux" id="what-is-desktop-environment-in-linux"></a>

A desktop environment is the **bundle of components that provide you with common graphical user interface (GUI) elements** such as icons, toolbars, wallpapers, and desktop widget**s**. Thanks to the desktop environment, you can use Linux graphically using your mouse and keyboard like you do in other operating systems like Windows and macOS.

There are several desktop environments, and these determine what your Linux system looks like and how you interact with it.

Most of the desktop environments have their set of integrated applications and utilities so that users get a uniform feel while using the OS. So, you get a file explorer, desktop search, menu of applications, wallpaper and screensaver utilities, text editors and more.

Without a desktop environment, your Linux system will just have a terminal-like utility, and you will have to interact with it using commands only.

### Different desktop environments in Linux

Think of the desktop environments as clothes. The clothes determine what you look like. If you wear skinny jeans and flat shoes, you would look good, but running or hiking in those clothes won’t be comfortable.

Some desktop environments such as [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/?ref=itsfoss.com) focus on a modern look and user experience, while desktop environments like [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org/?ref=itsfoss.com) focus more on using fewer computing resources than on fancy graphics.<br>

Your clothes depend on your need and determine your looks, the same is the case with the desktop environments. You have to decide whether you want something that looks good or something that lets your system run faster.

Some popular desktop environments are:

* KDE – Highly customizable desktop with moderate usage of system resources
* GNOME – Uses plenty of system resources but gives you a modern, polished system
* Xfce – Vintage look but light on resources
* LXDE – The entire focus is on using as few resources as possible

### Why are There so Many GUIs in Linux?

There are plenty of GUI options in Linux, unlike some operating systems that leave you with only one option. There are several good reasons why Linux has so many different types of GUIs.

The first reason is that the average Linux user appreciates choice. Linux has a real DIY spirit within its community, meaning a lot of users will build the solution that they want. Different types of users enjoy using Linux, and different GUIs are better suited for some than others.

Linux has experienced a surge in GUI options in recent years. They are all free and open-source, which is great for the community. However, with so many options available to users, it can be a challenge to decide which one you want to use on your system.

#### &#x20;KDE Plasma

KDE Plasma is a very popular desktop environment. Its lightweight design and customization options make KDE Plasma a very versatile platform. You have convenient features, such as mobile phone integration with your Linux system using KDE Connect.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (55).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The browser integration allows you to connect with a smartphone browser and use it as a remote control for browsing on your desktop, skipping music tracks on your computer, receiving notifications, and more. You can also share the clipboard between all devices connected with KDE Connect, which is very handy.

The KDE Plasma desktop experience gives users a lot of control over the desktop look and feel. Users can choose their color scheme, move panels anywhere they want them to be, or use a different system font. Users can download custom widgets and add anything from clocks to calendars straight to their panel.

KDE is available on Kubuntu, KDE Neon, OpenSUSE, and Fedora KDE. For a full list, you can check out the KDE [website](https://kde.org/distributions/).

#### GNOME

The GNOME desktop environment has been a popular choice for many Linux users over the years. Its popularity is due to the clean, minimalistic look.<br>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (56).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

GNOME has been designed with usability in mind and is the perfect setup for people who just need the basics to get some work done on their Linux machine. All of the features it offers are neatly tucked away in a desktop dock or application list.

This stability has meant that there are lots of popular Linux distros that use it as their default, and there are forks too, like Cinnamon, which is used with the very popular Mint Linux.

GNOME is a great desktop environment for those who want to customize their experience, but it can be heavy on resources. Older systems might struggle a little if they don’t have enough RAM, or if the processor is a few too many generations behind.

GNOME is a solid choice for experienced and new users alike. Most major distros ship with a few desktop environment options, and GNOME is very often included in this list. Distros that include it by default are Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian and OpenSUSE, to name a few.

### Budgie <a href="#c7fa" id="c7fa"></a>

Budgie is a desktop environment that is based on GNOME 3 but provides a more minimalist and elegant user interface with a single panel at the top and a dock at the bottom. Budgie was created by the developers of Solus as an original and distinctive desktop environment for their distribution. Budgie has gained popularity among users who appreciate its simplicity and beauty.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
### MATE <a href="#c632" id="c632"></a>

MATE is a desktop environment that is based on GNOME 2, which was the default desktop environment for many Linux distributions until it was replaced by GNOME 3 in 2011. MATE was created for users who were dissatisfied with the changes introduced by GNOME 3 and wanted to keep using the classic GNOME 2 interface. MATE has improved the GNOME 2 interface by adding new features and fixing bugs, while maintaining its simplicity and usability.
{% endhint %}

#### XFCE

The XFCE desktop environment is an excellent choice for those who want to have a more lightweight and customizable experience than GNOME offers. The interface can be customized, and the features you use most are available with one click from your application dock or menu bar, making it a good choice for PC enthusiasts who enjoy customizing their desktops.<br>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (57).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

XFCE proves to be a great choice if you need an environment that balances performance with user experience. It’s light on resources but still provides powerful customizations and features.

XFCE is so lightweight that it runs surprisingly well on older hardware. The interface, which may seem familiar to [Windows users](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/blog/certifications/microsoft/windows-to-linux-making-the-switch) due to its modern layout and visual appeal, is quite light on system resources.

It falls a little short in terms of customization options, but if you're looking for a desktop environment that looks good and runs well right out of the box, then this is a good choice.

#### LXDE

The **LXDE** (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) desktop environment is specifically designed for performance and energy efficiency. Its primary goal is to be fast and use minimal system resources, making it an ideal choice for older computers, low-power machines like the Raspberry Pi, or anyone who prefers a snappy, responsive desktop.<br>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (58).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

LXDE provides a traditional and familiar desktop interface. You'll find a single panel at the bottom of the screen, housing the application menu, quick-launch icons, open window list, and system tray. This simplicity means you can start working immediately without a steep learning curve. While it may not have the flashy animations of other environments, it delivers a clean and highly functional workspace where everything is just a click or two away.

A key strength of LXDE is its modular design. Each component of the desktop—from the file manager (PCManFM) to the panel and even the window border renderer—is a separate, independent application. This allows for incredible flexibility; you can easily replace any part of the system with an alternative you prefer, creating a truly customized lightweight setup.

Because of its minimal resource demands, LXDE is perfect for reviving old hardware that struggles with modern operating systems. It runs smoothly on systems with very little RAM and less powerful processors.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
#### LXQt

LXQt came to be after a merger between the LXDE and Razor-qt projects. It is built on the modern Qt toolkit (just like KDE Plasma) and is an extremely lightweight classic desktop that users adapt to quite quickly. Distributions that used to ship with LXDE (like Lubuntu) now use LXQt as their default.&#x20;

LXQt’s goal is to be fast and use as few resources as possible. It is designed from the ground up to use less RAM and CPU cycles, making it a great choice for older computers that would otherwise find themselves at a recycling center. The focus on system efficiency makes it viable for single-board computers (like the Raspberry Pi) or for anyone who wants their system to feel responsive and snappy.

LXQt is a no-frills user interface with a standard panel, app menu, and system tray. It doesn't try to reinvent the desktop wheel—it just focuses on maximum speed. It isn’t the prettiest desktop out there, but it offers a clean and functional system that is really stable.

If you’re looking for a desktop that tries to get you maximum power from minimal hardware specs, then LXQt is one of the best choices right now.

### Difference between Terminal, Console, Shell, and Command Line

Terminal, Console, Shell, and Command line all are ways to give the command to the computer but all these have different functions. A terminal is a text-based interface that is used to type commands or take input and view the output. A console is a type of terminal that is used to interact with operating system programs. Shell is used to interact with the operating system's kernel. It interprets and processes the commands entered by the user. The Command Line is an area where the user enters the commands.

### **What is a Terminal?**

A terminal is a text input and output environment. A terminal window, also known as a terminal emulator, is a text-only window that emulates a console in a [graphical user interface (GUI)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-graphics/what-is-graphical-user-interface/). In other words, a graphical user interface application from which we can access a user's console. A terminal is a program that allows you to run a shell. Is a device with a human-readable display that accepts a stream of characters and displays them. Only the chars are making their way there. They're commonly used in networking and device debug interfaces.

### **What is a Console?**

A console is a physical terminal; an instrument panel containing computer controls. A console is a type of terminal. Is a window in which your text-mode programs are active. This window recognizes key presses and is aware of its width and height. A full-screen mode is an option.

### **What is a Shell ?**

Shell stands for the command-line interpreter. A shell is a program that processes commands and outputs the results. A shell is a layer that sits on top of the kernel: 1) It interprets and processes the commands entered by the user. Unlike users, the shell has access to the kernel. Users can only gain access to the kernel by using a shell and entering commands (i.e. running programs). System calls are used by programs to gain access to kernel functionality. The system API is made up of all system calls.

### **What is a Command-Line ?**&#x20;

A command line is an area to the right of the command prompt on an all-text display mode computer monitor (typically a CRT or LCD panel) where a user enters commands and data. This is the line where you type commands. It is typically used to indicate that you must run something in the text mode window (command line interface) provided by your operating system.<br>

### User Management in Linux

User management is a core function of Linux system administration. It controls system access, enforces security, and ensures users have the correct privileges for their tasks. Linux supports **multi-user environments**, making it ideal for everything from personal laptops to large enterprise systems. Efficient user management:

* Secures the system from unauthorized access
* Ensures users can perform their roles without interfering with others
* Helps in auditing and tracking user activity

#### Understanding Linux User IDs (UIDs) <a href="#understanding-linux-user-ids-uids" id="understanding-linux-user-ids-uids"></a>

Linux systems typically support up to **60,000 users**, making them suitable for large-scale use.<br>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Admins manage users by creating, modifying, and deleting accounts, setting permissions, and enforcing access policies. This ensures users can perform tasks without compromising system integrity.

#### **Types of Users in Linux**

Linux is a multi-user operating system, meaning multiple users can access and operate the system simultaneously. Each user type serves a specific purpose and has different levels of access and control.

Below are the main types of users you will encounter in Linux:

| User Type                  | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Root (Superuser)**       | Full system control. Can install software, change config files, and delete anything. Powerful but risky. |
| **Regular User**           | Limited access. Can create files, run applications, but not modify system-level settings.                |
| **Sudo User**              | Regular user with temporary admin rights via the `sudo` command. Common in modern systems.               |
| **System/Service Account** | Non-human accounts used by services (e.g., `mysql`, `nginx`). Limited privileges.                        |
| **Guest User**             | Temporary users with minimal privileges. Changes are not saved after logout.                             |

### **User Groups** <a href="#user-groups" id="user-groups"></a>

A user group is a collection of users. If you give permission to a group, all users in that group get the same access. This makes it easier to manage file and system permissions for many users at once.

#### 1. **Primary Group (Default for files)** <a href="#primary-group" id="primary-group"></a>

* Every Linux user is assigned one primary group.
* When a user creates a file, the group ownership of that file is automatically set to their primary group.
* By default, this group usually has the same name as the user.
* It helps manage file ownership cleanly without much extra configuration.

#### **2. Secondary Group(Additional Permissions)** <a href="#secondary-group" id="secondary-group"></a>

* A user can be a part of multiple secondary groups.
* These groups provide extra access to files, folders, or services.
* They are commonly used for team-based access or system-level permissions (e.g., accessing Docker, video devices, or running sudo).

### User Account Management Commands <a href="#user-account-management-commands" id="user-account-management-commands"></a>

#### **Assign a Password** <a href="#id-4-assign-a-password" id="id-4-assign-a-password"></a>

The `passwd` command is used to assign a password to the user. After entering the command, you will be prompted to input a new password for the user.

```
passwd username
```

#### Forgotten Passwords <a href="#id-1-forgotten-passwords" id="id-1-forgotten-passwords"></a>

Users may forget their passwords, leading to access issues. Administrators can reset passwords using the `passwd` command.

```
sudo passwd username
```

This command prompts for a new password, restoring user access.
